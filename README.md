# Limitless Enchantments
Limitless Enchantments is a mod that lets you remove the limit of maximum enchantment levels with the `maxEnchantmentLevel` game rule. (There is still the 255 limit)

For example; with the rule `maxEnchantmentLevel` set to 255, any librarian trades with enchanted books' level will be between 1 and 255, ignoring the book's maximum level.

The cost of the trades are capped at 64 emeralds, so even an enchantment with level 255 will still cost 64 emerals.

If `maxEnchantmentLevel` is set to 0, the mod will be disabled entirely and maximum levels will work normally.

This mod is compatible with Trade Cycling mod!

This mod requires the latest Minecraft version (Currently 1.21.4) and [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api).
