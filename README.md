# Limitless Enchantments
Limitless Enchantments is a mod that lets you remove the limit of maximum enchantment levels with the `maxEnchantmentLevel` game rule. (There is still the 255 limit and the default value of the rule is 10)

For example; with the rule `maxEnchantmentLevel` set to 255, any librarian trades with enchanted books' level will be between 1 and 255, ignoring the book's maximum level.

The cost of the trades are capped at 64 emeralds, so even an enchantment with level 255 will still cost 64 emerals.

If `maxEnchantmentLevel` is set to 0, the mod will be disabled entirely and maximum levels will work normally.

## Removing Incompatibilities
With the game rule `noIncompatibilities`, the game will allow you to to combine mutually exclusive enchantments like Infinity and Mending together.
